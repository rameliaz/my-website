Hi everyone! Welcome to my **very first** personal website. I'm so excited when figuring out that `blogdown` package is easier to manage than I previously thought. I'll regularly post my random thoughts here, either in Bahasa or in English. As a bonus, here I present a photo of [Urquhart Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urquhart_Castle) and [Loch Ness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness) from my solo trip to Inverness - just shortly after my master graduation. I fell in love with this place and was thinking about Scotland when I wrote this first post. I miss Edinburgh (and Scotland, in general) and really hope to be able to come back one day.

Hope you all have a wonderful day! :smile:
