The course aims to encourage students to familiarize themselves with most common personality theories, by exploring its common ground, core arguments, and real-life evidences. Students are therefore provided with opportunity to obtain the idea how personality is measured and evaluated.

By the end of this course, students should be capable of: <br>
- Identifying core assumptions of several notable personality theories (inner psychic and trait paradigm) </br>
- Corroborating personality theories to the real context through text (autobiography) and scientific evidences <br>
- Being familiar to a limited range of options to measure personality

**Assignments** <br>
**Short essay (recalling and reconstructing)**: After each session, the students will be asked to write a short 100-word take on the topic that is discussed that day. Students will be given 20 minutes to write the short essay and are allowed to ask questions to the lecturers, while writing up their essay. The assignment starts on week 4.

NB: I'm aware that some of you might have difficulties in adjusting your daily life during the pandemic and it's quite unrealistic to expect you finishing the short essay a day after the lecture. I will then ease the deadline by allowing you submitting the short essay whenever you have time, as long as **by the end of this semester (Saturday, 22/05/2020 (EXTENDED)), you have completed your short essay for each topic in this course**.
