I'm (**Amelia**) currently a PhD student at Ludwig Maximilians Universit채t M체nchen, working on a project focuses on investigating mental conceptualization of science and religion relationship. Additionally, I'm broadly interested in researching health misinformation, conspiracy belief, and public attitudes to science. I'm also very passionate about research methods, meta-research, computational reproducibility, psychometrics, and advanced statistical analysis. Apart from my main responsibility, I'm determined to independently practise my [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) programming skill.  

I was born in [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok), a beautiful island next to Bali, but spent most of my childhood in [Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Apart from my academic life, I like to cook, listen to Japanese Rock bands, such as [L'Arc~en~Ciel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Arc-en-Ciel), [Do As Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_As_Infinity) and [Wagakki Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagakki_Band), and read *manga* (my personal favourites are [Gals!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gals!) and [The Promised Neverland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Promised_Neverland)).

**For UNAIR Students: If you'd like to set up an appointment, please request it through [my Doodle page](https://doodle.com/mm/rizqyameliazein/book-a-time). Please note that I'm in a study leave until 2025 (expected) so I'm no longer available for teaching or undergraduate thesis supervision.**
