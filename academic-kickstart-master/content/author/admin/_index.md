Rizqy **Amelia** Zein is an assistant professor of social psychology, working at Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya, Indonesia. I'm also a researcher-in-training at [Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE)](https://igdore.org/), a volunteer at [INArxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/) - a OSF-hosted pre-print server in Indonesia, and a tutor in [Wawasan Terbimbing Sains Terbuka Indonesia (WIBISANA)](https://eliademy.com/app/a/courses/b566eddbba) -- the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) of open scientific practices in Bahasa Indonesia. Just recently, my ECR friends and I decided to start [Airlangga #OpenScience](https://sainsterbukaua.github.io), which mainly focuses on promoting open scientific practices in Universitas Airlangga (and beyond).

As an aspiring PhD, I'm interested in conducting research on science denialism by looking at its relation with conspiracy belief, collective narcissism, epistemic virtue/belief, religiosity and general/intellectual humility. I'm also very passionate about research methods, meta-research, reproducibility, psychometrics, and advanced statistical analysis. Apart from my daily responsibilities, I'm determined to practise my [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) programming skill and created this website using `blogdown` package. My favourite [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) packages are including `lavaan`, `lme4`, `metaverse`, `tidyverse`, and `psych`.

I was born in [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok), a beautiful island next to Bali, but spent most of my childhood in [Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Apart from my academic life, I enjoy cooking for my husband [Ilham](https://iaridlo.blog/) and my 3.5 year old daughter, Ayesha.
