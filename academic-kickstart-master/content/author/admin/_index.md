I'm (**Amelia**) currently a PhD student at Ludwig Maximilians Universit채t M체nchen, working on a project investigating how individuals mentally relate scientific and religious explanations. Additionally, I'm broadly interested in researching health misinformation, conspiracy belief, and public attitudes to science. I'm also very passionate about research methods, meta-research, computational reproducibility, psychometrics, and latent variable modeling. Apart from my main responsibility, I'm determined to independently practice my [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) programming skill.  

I was born in [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok), one of Bali's neighbouring islands but spent most of my childhood in [Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Apart from my academic life, I like to cook, listen to Japanese Rock bands, such as [L'Arc~en~Ciel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Arc-en-Ciel), [Do As Infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_As_Infinity) and [Wagakki Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagakki_Band), and read *manga* (my personal favourites are [Gals!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gals!) and [The Promised Neverland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Promised_Neverland)).

**For UNAIR Students: If you'd like to arrange an appointment, please request it through [my booking page](https://calendly.com/ameliazein/calendar). Please note that I'm on study leave until 2025 (expected), so I'm no longer available for teaching or undergraduate thesis supervision.**
