**Amelia** is working at Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya, Indonesia, a researcher-in-training at [Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE)](https://igdore.org/), a volunteer at [INArxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/) - a OSF-hosted pre-print server in Indonesia, and a tutor in [Wawasan Terbimbing Sains Terbuka Indonesia (WIBISANA)](https://eliademy.com/app/a/courses/b566eddbba) -- the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) of open scientific practices in Bahasa Indonesia. Just recently, my coworkers and I decided to start [Airlangga #OpenScience](https://sainsterbukaua.github.io), which mainly focuses on promoting open scientific practices in Universitas Airlangga (and beyond).

As an aspiring PhD, I'm interested in researching moral reasoning, norms violation, and moral disengagement in the context of online social interaction. I'm also very passionate about research methods, meta-research, computational reproducibility, psychometrics, and advanced statistical analysis. My second line of interests are health misinformation, conspiracy beliefs, and public attitudes to science. Apart from my main responsibility, I'm determined to independently practise my [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) programming skill. My favourite [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) packages are including [`lavaan`](http://lavaan.ugent.be/tutorial/index.html), [`lme4`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf), [`metaverse`](https://rmetaverse.github.io/), [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [`psych`](https://personality-project.org/r/psych/), and I created this website using [`blogdown`](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/). 

I was born in [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok), a beautiful island next to Bali, but spent most of my childhood in [Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Apart from my academic life, I enjoy cooking for my husband [Ilham](https://iaridlo.net/) and my daughter, Ayesha.
