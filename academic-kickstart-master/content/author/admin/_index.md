Rizqy **Amelia** Zein is a social psychology instructor and an early-career researcher, working for Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya, Indonesia. I am also a researcher-in-training at IGDORE and a member of Tim Sains Terbuka (TST) Indonesia - so my work mainly focuses on promoting good research practice and have conducted several workshops on improving research methods and advanced statistical analysis.

I am an aspiring PhD, interested in conducting research on public understanding in science by looking at its relation with conspiracy belief, collective narcissism, epistemic virtue/belief, religiosity and general/intellectual humility. I am also interested in the issues of research methods, replicability and statistical analysis. Apart from my daily responsibilities, I am regularly practising my [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) programming skill and created this website using `blogdown` package. My favourite [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) packages are `lavaan`, `lme4`, `tidyverse`, and `psych`.

I was born in [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok), a beautiful island next to Bali, but spent most of my childhood in [Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Apart from my academic life, I really like to cook for my husband [Ilham](https://iaridlo.blog/) and my 3.5 year old daughter, Ayesha.
