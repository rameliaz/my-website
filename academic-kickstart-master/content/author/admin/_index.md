**Amelia** is working at Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Airlangga in Surabaya, Indonesia, a researcher-in-training at [Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE)](https://igdore.org/), and a co-founder of [Airlangga #OpenScience](https://sainsterbukaua.github.io), which mainly focuses on promoting open scientific practices in Universitas Airlangga (and beyond).

As an aspiring PhD, I'm interested in researching moral reasoning, norms violations, moral judgment, and self-construal. My second line of interest is researching why people intuitively trust non-health expert for health advice and how conspiracy beliefs could affect public attitudes to science. I'm also very passionate about research methods, meta-research, computational reproducibility, psychometrics, and advanced statistical analysis. Apart from my main responsibility, I'm determined to independently practise my [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org) programming skill.  

I was born in [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok), a beautiful island next to Bali, but spent most of my childhood in [Surabaya, Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya). Apart from my academic life, I enjoy cooking for my husband [Ilham](https://iaridlo.net/) and my daughter, Ayesha.
