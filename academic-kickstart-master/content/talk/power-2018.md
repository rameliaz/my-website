abstract = "In this workshop, I introduced the concept of statistical power, which is long neglected in psychological research. I also emphasised and clarified the definition of some important NHST concepts, such as alpha, beta, type 1 & 2 error, and p-value. At the end of the workshop, I encouraged participants to perform a priori power analysis to determine and plan sampe size prior to data collection."
